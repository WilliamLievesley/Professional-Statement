# Professional-Statement
I am an IT professional with 3 years worth of experience in securing and managing technology systems. Having spent many years in this field I have discovered a new found passion for the safeguarding of the digital space. Through both my work,my own project and technical background I honed a lot of technical skills that allow me to troubleshoot and secure sensitive data. 

To advance my knowledge in cybersecurity, I have earned the ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) certificate which has taught me the foundation and fundamentals of security. Furthermore I continue to learn as I complete the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate. Through this Certification I have learned how to Identify threats and use SIEM tools to protect networks and data and have acquired hands-on experience with Python, Linux and SQL.

I am seeking opportunities to apply my IT expertise while I continue to expand my knowledge in this field. My goal is to use my skills to better protect organisations from threats and to specialise in this sector.
