# Professional-Statement
I am an IT professional with 3 years worth of experience in securing and managing technology systems. Having spent many years in this field I have discovered a new found passion for the safeguarding of the digital space. Through both my work,my own project and technical background I honed a lot of technical skills that allow me to troubleshoot and secure sensitive data. 

To advance my knowledge in cybersecurity, I have earned the ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) certificate which has taught me the foundation and fundamentals of security. Furthermore I continue to learn as I complete the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate. Through this Certification I have learned how to Identify threats and use SIEM tools to protect networks and data and have acquired hands-on experience with Python, Linux and SQL.

I value a sense of responsibility and duty as these are what motivate me to be the best I can be within the field I choose to specialize in. It gives me a sense of purpose and fulfillment to be trusted with important tasks. I am committed to further development and seeking opportunities to apply my IT expertise. My goal is to use my skills to better protect organisations from threats and to specialise in this sector.
