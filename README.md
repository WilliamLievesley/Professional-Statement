# Professional-Statement
I have always been passionate about computers and technology, and I believe my skills and security mindset, combined with five years of experience in IT, make me a strong fit for a career in cybersecurity. Naturally detail-oriented and cautious, I approach problems with a security-first perspective, always thinking ahead to mitigate potential risks.

Currently, I am exploring different areas within cybersecurity, with a particular interest in SOC operations and Blue Team security. I want to develop my expertise in threat detection, incident response, and system defense to contribute to a secure digital environment. While I am still refining my focus, I am eager to gain hands-on experience and grow into a role where I can actively defend against cyber threats.

I have gained confidence working with SIEM tools, though I continuously strive to improve my proficiency. One of the challenges I faced early in my journey was understanding TCP commands in the command line, but through persistent research and practice, I overcame this hurdle. Learning from such experiences has strengthened my ability to adapt, troubleshoot, and solve technical problems.

One of my proudest achievements so far is earning the Security+, marking a significant milestone in my professional growth. I am committed to further developing my skills, obtaining more certifications, and gaining real-world experience to excel in cybersecurity.

As I continue on this journey, I am eager to learn, collaborate, and contribute to a strong security culture. I welcome opportunities to connect with like-minded professionals and build a future in cybersecurity.
